Problem solving using python

## Required Software
- python 3 [Click here To download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Day1
### 1. Finding maximum of 3 numbers

- You can download MaxOF3.py from [here](https://github.com/SkBadulla/Python-Programs/blob/master/MaxOf3.py)
```
In this program we need to initialize 3 values as a,b,c.
Other wise we need to read or prompt values from user using input() method.
After Initiolizing or reading values, we have to compare a with b and c, 
if a is bigger than b and c it prints a value
otherwise we have to compare b and c, 
if b is bigger than c it prints b otherwise it prints c.
```

### 2. Unit converters

- You can download UnitConverter.py from [here](https://github.com/SkBadulla/Python-Programs/blob/master/UnitConverter.py)

```
In this progrsm we are building logic for converting units of length i.e, km to m,m to km etc.
```

### 3.  Interest calculators

- You can download SimpleInterest.py from [here](https://github.com/SkBadulla/Python-Programs/blob/master/SimpleInterest.py)

```
For building this logic we will get the interest of principle amount for perticular amount
```

### 4.  Math Table Generation

- You can download mathTable.py from [here](https://github.com/SkBadulla/Python-Programs/blob/master/mathTable.py)

### 4.  GCD of 2 Numbers

- You can download GCDOfNums.py from [here](https://github.com/SkBadulla/Python-Programs/blob/master/gcdOfNums.py)
